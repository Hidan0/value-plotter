# Serial Monitoring

## Introduction

A simple tool to monitor and plot values based on [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui).

## Motivation

Since I am using Rust and esp-rs as my programming environment for my embedded systems exam project, and they do not provide a plotter, I needed a simple tool to visualize sensor data over time.
