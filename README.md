# Serial Plotter

## Introduction

A simple tool to monitor and plot values based on [egui](https://crates.io/crates/egui).

This project was based on the following [YT video](https://youtu.be/zUvHkkkrmIY).

## Motivation

Since I am using Rust and esp-rs as my programming environment for my embedded systems exam project, and they do not provide a plotter, I needed a simple tool to visualize sensor data over time.
